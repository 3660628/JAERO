JDDS v2.0.0

The [jddsmsk.ino](jddsmsk.ino) is the main program file for the JDDS host that resides on the Arduino. [jddsmsk.ino](jddsmsk.ino) requires the [libraries](../libraries) to be installed. The Arduino IDE can be used to compile [jddsmsk.ino](jddsmsk.ino) and upload it to the Arduino.

This version of JDDS breaks backwards compatibility with previous versions and is intended for MSK only.
