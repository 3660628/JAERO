# JMSK
An MSK modem written in C++ Qt

Currently it is being turned into a Aero-L decoder.

This program can demodulate and modulate MSK (*minimum shift keying*) signals. Demodulation is performed using the soundcard, while modulation can be either via the soundcard or the via an external device to RF (*Radio Frequency*) frequencies using some simple hardware as described in the [JDDS-Arduino](JDDS-Arduino) section.

The demodulator implements a coherent MSK demodulator type as seen at http://jontio.zapto.org/hda1/msk-demodulation2.html.

The demodulator uses the technique that treats the signal similar to [OQPSK] but with sine wave transitions rather than rectangular transitions. The BER (*Bit Error Rate*) versus EbNo (*Energy per bit to Noise power density*) performance in the presence of AWGN (*Additive White Gaussian Noise*) is the same as coherently demodulated differentially encoded [BPSK]. While designed for MSK it will also demodulate [GMSK]. The signal is supplied via the audio input of the computerâ€™s soundcard.
The software implements differential decoding hence the modulator must use differential encoding. The demodulator can decode varicode encoded text. The output of the demodulator can be directed to either a built-in console or to a [UDP] network port.
